LLSM3DTools

Tools for the analysis of 3D live images from lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM), including image deskew, point detection and point tracking.

The method is based on 

Aguet, F., Upadhyayula, S., Gaudin, R., Chou, Y.Y., Cocucci, E., He, K., Chen, B.C., Mosaliganti, K., Pasham, M., Skillern, W. and Legant, W.R., 2016. Membrane dynamics of dividing cells imaged by lattice light-sheet microscopy. Molecular biology of the cell, 27(22), pp.3418-3435.

Compared to the original method, we have several improvements, like computing efficiency, scalabilty, detection in low SNR conditions, Gaussian mixture fitting, bug fixation and so on.
